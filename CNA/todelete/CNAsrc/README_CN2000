This is common neighbor analysis code developed by Srinivasan Srivilliputhur,
initially at the University of Washington and later at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory (USA).  
0) To run the code use the script RunCNA.scr (ensure that it is executable).
   See the SampleRuns directory for sample input, output, and CN*.log files.

1) You can write code to read your own input and print your output.  
   Currently, it supports my parallel code LASS's CK/SN format, SPaSM format,
   and Mike Baskes's Dynamo format.  In the RunCNA.scr you specify -F baskes
   to let the code know that the input is in Dynamo format. 
   NOTE: To see various read/write functions see CNio.c file

2) Details of CNA are in: 
     a. Clarke and Jonsson, PRE 47, 3975 (1991).
     b. Faken and Jonsson,  Comp. Mater. Sci., (1994)

3) Specify a cutoff distance that is half-way between the first and second
   nearest neighbors. For BCC systems, this is little beyond the 2nd nearest 
   neighbors since the 1st (1NN) and 2nd nearest neighbors (2NN) are 
   only ~10% apart. To eliminate thermal noise, minimize the system for about 
   100 iterations and analyze the output *.r file using CNA.

4) Since we know what type of atoms (fcc, hcp, etc.) are in ground state 
   structure, another approach to selecting the cutoff distance is to 
   systematically rcut and determine the number of ground state atoms vs rcut.
   Choose rcut that yields the maximum number of atoms that has same symmetry 
   as ground state atoms.

5) In Summary:
   ----------
     a. An atom is FCC if its coordination number (CN) is 12 and all these 
	neighbors are 421 type pairs (i.e. 12 421 pairs for each FCC atom)
     b.	HCP atom has CN=12, and these are divided as six 421 and 6 422 pairs
     c. BCC atom has CN=14 (8 1NN and 6 2NN) divided among eight 666 and 
	six 444 pairs.
     d. Icosahedral order means 13 (555) pairs and/or large number of (433), 
	(544) pairs.

6) Currently I've included AlFcc.r, AlBcc.r, AlHcp.atm as sample atoms files
   in the Dynamo Format
